# Prosper Loan Data Exploration 
## by David Shim


## Dataset

> The data exploration is based on analysis on Loan Data from Prosper Data. The dataset consists of 113000 loans with 81 variables including loan amount, borrower rate, term, occupation etc.

## Summary of Findings

> My main goal was to figure what attributes contributes to the borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR). 
> The plot shows the borrower APR is shown as multimodal. There is a small peak around APR = 0.1 and a large peak around 0.2. A very shape peak can be observed around 0.35. If we look the debttoincome ratio, the distributuion has unimodal peak around 0.18 with a very sharp peak at 0.25. If we look at the distribution of original loan amount, the ery sharp peaks can be observed at 5000,10000, 15000, 20000, and 25000. It suggest the loans are multiples of 5000. The distribution of stated monthly income is right screwed.
> The scatter plot between BorrowerAPR, Monthly Income, and Loan amount showed that more the loan amount, the lower the APR. It also showed positive correlation between the loan original amount and the stated monthly income.
The borrower APR and loan amount was negatively correlated when the Prosper ratings are from HR to B, but the relation is turned to be positive when the ratings are A and AA. Also, the borrower APR decreases as the term for people with HR-C raings increases. But for people with B-AA ratings, the APR increases as the borrow term increases.
> The plot between BorrowerAPR and Loan amount showed that the range of APR decreases as the loan amount increases. The correlation between the borrower APR and the loan original amount was negative.
> The multivariate exploration showed that the relationship between borrower APR and loan amount turns from negative to slightly positive when the Prosper ratings increased from HR to AA. I then explored the rating and term effects on loan amount, it shows that with better Prosper rating, the loan amount of all three terms increases, the increase amplitude of loan amount between terms also becomes larger.
