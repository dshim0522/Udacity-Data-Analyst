# Flight Data Visualization
## by David Shim


## Dataset

The data consisted of 73546 records of flights, for the US, over 5 years, from 1987 to 1992. As the original files were too big, I created some random samples for this learning study. There are time variables (mainly expected times and delays), numeric variables and text variables such are origins, destinations and carriers' names.
